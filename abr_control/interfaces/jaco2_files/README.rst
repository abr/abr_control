ABR Control Jaco2 Files
==========

This code is designed for interfacing with the Jaco2 arm from Ubuntu 14.04.

Before running, you will need to compile the shared library, to interface from the C++ functions to Python. This can be done by running

python setup.py build_ext -i 

from this (interfaces/jaco2_files) directory.
