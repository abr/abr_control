ABR_Control: Robotic arm control in Python

Installation
============

The ABR_Control library depends on NumPy, SymPy, CloudPickle, and Cython,
and we recommend that you install these libraries before ABR_Control.
If you're not sure how to do this, we recommend using
`Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.

To install ABR_Control::

    pip install abr_control

If you'd like to install ABR_Control from source,
clone this repository and run::

    python setup.py develop build_ext -i

ABR_Control is tested to work on Python 3.4+.
